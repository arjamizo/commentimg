# commentimg README

Sometimes it is much easier to explain something by drawing a picture. This extension
allows you to put references to pictures in your code as pop-up images.

## Workflow
Inside a comment write
```
<cmg path_to_your_iamge>
```
Only images with extension `png`, `jpeg` and `jpg` are accepted.

### Bad stuff
It's not possible to put images directly in the code as it's implemented
as textarea.
